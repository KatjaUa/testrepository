            I can see that you're calling JavaScript functions directly from HTML event handlers. 
            While this works, it can make the code more challenging to understand and maintain 
            as the code grows in complexity. For instance, if you add more scripts to your HTML, 
            it may become difficult to identify which script each function belongs to. 

            Instead, I highly recommend defining event listeners in your script file. 
            This approach keeps your JavaScript logic separate from the HTML, making the code cleaner and more manageable.
